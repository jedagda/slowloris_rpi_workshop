Hello Friend,
Greetings samsepi0l,
We have been seen the great work that you have done over the past few years
and we are impressed.
We are glad you have taken on our offer to join our family in the fight
against evil, however you must prove to the rest of us
that you are worthy of being one of us. We are DedSec, you could say that
we are the good guys; even though our targets do not think so.
What I'm about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of
us. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly
running the world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones
that are invisible.
The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission.
We are fighting on the side of the people and protect them against evil
organizations.
DedSec does not take kindly to organizations that take advantage of the
little people.

Our latest intel has uncovered a secret plot by the multi-billion dollar
company Epic Games. We learned that they are currently being bankrolled by
foreign powers to install
some nasty spyware on their customer's machines and in turn they are giving
their customer's information and computer's access to these foreign powers.

It's your job to take down Epic Game's storefront to prevent people from
continuing to fall for their predatory practices.

This will definitely hurt them where it matters.

We have included the necessary tools for you to get this job done.

Your next step is to go to this directory /home/samsepi0l/slowloris so make
sure you write this directory down somewhere.
On that directory, there is a README file that you must read before you
engage.

<p>But before you do, make sure you leave your vim console safely.

1. Press the esc button
2. Type :q and press enter

See you on the other side.
Dade

~We do not forgive,
~We do not compromise.
~We are DedSec
~Expect us
